# DZ-DNS
AUTOMATION BASH | EXTRACT LINK AND SUBDOMAIN THECK CHECK FOR DNS AND INFOS

# README for Automation Bash Script: `dzdns.sh`

## Overview

The `dzdns.sh` script is a Bash utility designed for extracting links and subdomains from a given URL, as well as performing DNS checks and gathering information about those domains. It simplifies the process of collecting relevant domain data for security assessments, web monitoring, or development purposes.

## Features

- Extracts links and subdomains from the provided URL.
- Checks DNS records for the extracted subdomains.
- Retrieves and displays important information about the domains, such as A records, CNAMEs, and more.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Bash (version 4.0 or higher)
- `curl` for fetching web content.
- `dig` or `nslookup` for DNS checks.
- Optional: `jq` for JSON parsing (if your script uses JSON formatted inputs or outputs).

## Usage

### 1. Download the Script

Download the `dzdns.sh` script to your local machine.

```bash
wget [url_to_dzdns.sh]
# or
curl -O [url_to_dzdns.sh]
```

### 2. Make the Script Executable

Before running the script, you need to give it executable permissions.

```bash
chmod +x dzdns.sh
```

### 3. Run the Script

To use the script, open a terminal and run:

```bash
./dzdns.sh <url>
```

Replace `<url>` with the URL you wish to analyze. For example:

```bash
./dzdns.sh https://example.com
```

### 4. Script Options

Depending on the implementation, the script may support options like:

```bash
-h, --help          Show help information and usage examples.
--dns-check         Perform DNS checks on extracted domains only.
--extract-links     Extract links only without performing DNS checks.
```

### 5. Example Output

When you run the script, you should expect output that can include:

- A list of extracted links and subdomains.
- The results of DNS queries including types of records (A, CNAME, etc.).
- Any errors encountered during execution (e.g., if a domain doesnâ€™t exist).
